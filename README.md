# 2D-Navier-Stokes-Flow-Modeler
The flow through a two-dimensional rectangular mixing chamber is modeled
using the non-dimensional continuity equation, 2-dimensional Navier-Stokes 
equations, and a convective/diffusive transport equation. The process 
include the use of viscous Burgersâ€™, TVD-RK3, WENO-5, and Crank-Nicolson ADI
schemes to model the flow with Gauss-Seidel method and V-cycle technique.
Three different Reynolds Numbers and two different Schmidt 
numbers are tested. After validating results with a grid convergence index 
(GCI) analysis, all results fell into the asymptotic regime and conclusions were 
drawn.
